To do this, first look at your game screen and note down how much resources you have (for example, 100 metal). Then go back to cheat engine and type 100 in the "Value" box under "Scan Type". Make sure that "Exact Value" and "4 Bytes" are selected as well.
  
Then click on "First Scan" and wait for a few seconds. You should see a list of addresses and values on the left panel of cheat engine. These are all the possible locations in the game's memory where your resource value is stored.
  
Now go back to your game and spend some resources (for example, build something or fire a weapon). Then look at your game screen again and note down how much resources you have left (for example, 80 metal).
  
Go back to cheat engine and type 80 in the "Value" box under "Scan Type". Then click on "Next Scan" and wait for a few seconds. You should see a smaller list of addresses and values on the left panel of cheat engine.
  
Repeat this process until you have only one or a few addresses left on the list. These are the exact locations in the game's memory where your resource value is stored.
  
Now select one or all of these addresses by clicking on them or pressing Ctrl+A. Then right-click on them and select "Change Record" > "Value".
