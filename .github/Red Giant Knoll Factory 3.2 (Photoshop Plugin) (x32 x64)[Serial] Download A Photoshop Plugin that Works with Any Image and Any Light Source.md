## How to Use Red Giant Knoll Factory 3.2 for Photoshop
 
Now that you have installed Red Giant Knoll Factory 3.2 for Photoshop, you might be wondering how to use it. In this section, we will give you a brief overview of the plugin's features and how to apply them to your images.
 
### Accessing the Plugin
 
To access Red Giant Knoll Factory 3.2 for Photoshop, you need to open an image in Photoshop and go to Filter > Red Giant > Knoll Factory 3.2. This will launch the plugin's interface, which consists of three main panels: Presets, Elements, and Options.
 
### Using Presets
 
The Presets panel allows you to choose from a variety of predefined lens flares and lighting effects that you can apply to your image with one click. You can browse through the categories and subcategories of presets and preview them on your image before applying them. You can also save your own presets and load them later.
 
### Customizing Elements
 
The Elements panel allows you to customize the individual components of the lens flare or lighting effect that you have selected or created. You can add, delete, duplicate, or rearrange the elements as you wish. You can also adjust the parameters of each element, such as color, brightness, scale, position, angle, blur, and more.
 
### Changing Options
 
The Options panel allows you to change the global settings of the plugin, such as the blending mode, opacity, scale, rotation, and offset of the lens flare or lighting effect. You can also enable or disable features such as motion blur, noise reduction, edge blending, and color correction.
 
### Applying the Plugin
 
Once you are happy with your lens flare or lighting effect, you can apply it to your image by clicking on OK. This will create a new layer in Photoshop with the plugin's output. You can then edit this layer as you would normally do in Photoshop, such as changing its opacity, blending mode, mask, or filters.
