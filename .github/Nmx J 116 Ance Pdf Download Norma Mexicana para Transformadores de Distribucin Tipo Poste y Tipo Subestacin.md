Distribution transformers are devices that reduce the voltage of electricity from high to low levels, suitable for residential or commercial use. They are essential for the transmission and distribution of electric power in any country. In Mexico, there are specific standards that regulate the design, construction, testing and performance of distribution transformers. These standards are issued by the Asociacion de Normalizacion y Certificacion, A.C. (ANCE), a non-profit organization that promotes quality and safety in electrical products and services.

One of the most important standards for distribution transformers is the NMX-J-116-ANCE-2014, which specifies the requirements and characteristics of overhead type and substation type distribution transformers. This standard was published in December 2014 and entered into force in August 2015, replacing the previous version from 2005. The NMX-J-116-ANCE-2014 covers transformers with rated power from 5 to 500 kVA, rated voltage from 2.4 to 34.5 kV, and frequency of 60 Hz. It also defines the terms and symbols, the classification and marking, the construction and materials, the tests and inspections, and the guarantees and certificates of conformity for distribution transformers.
