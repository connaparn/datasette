## Matrices and Systems of Linear Equations
 
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices can be used to represent various types of data, such as coefficients, variables, or solutions of a system of linear equations. A system of linear equations is a set of equations that involve linear combinations of variables. For example, the following system has three equations and three unknowns:
 
$$ \beginalign\* x + 2y - z &= 3 \\ 2x - y + z &= 1 \\ -x + y + 2z &= 4 \endalign\* $$

We can write this system in matrix form as follows:
 
$$ \beginbmatrix 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 2 & -1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 2 \endbmatrix \beginbmatrix x \\ y \\ z \endbmatrix = \beginbmatrix 3 \\ 1 \\ 4 \endbmatrix $$
 
The matrix on the left is called the coefficient matrix, the matrix in the middle is called the variable matrix, and the matrix on the right is called the constant matrix. We can also write this system more compactly using a single matrix called the augmented matrix:
 
$$ \beginbmatrix 1 & 2 & -1 & | & 3 \\ 2 & -1 & 1 & | & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 2 & | & 4 \endbmatrix $$
 
To solve a system of linear equations, we can use various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. One of the most common methods is called Gaussian elimination, which involves performing elementary row operations on the augmented matrix to reduce it to a simpler form called row echelon form. A matrix is in row echelon form if it satisfies the following conditions:
 
- The first nonzero element in each row (called the leading entry) is 1.
- Each leading entry is in a column to the right of the leading entry in the previous row.
- All entries below a leading entry are zero.

For example, using Gaussian elimination, we can transform the augmented matrix above to the following row echelon form:
 
$$ \beginbmatrix 1 & 2 & -1 & | & 3 \\ 0 & -5 & 3 & | & -5 \\ 0 & 0 & -5 & | & -5 \endbmatrix $$
 
From this form, we can easily find the values of the variables by using back substitution. Starting from the bottom row, we have:
 
$$ \beginalign\* -5z &= -5 \implies z &= 1 \\ -5y + 3z &= -5 \implies y &= 0 \\ x + 2y - z &= 3 \implies x &= 2 \endalign\* $$
 
Therefore, the solution of the system is $(x,y,z) = (2,0,1)$.
