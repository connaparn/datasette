Freeservers Crackme Exe is a small program that tests your reverse engineering skills. Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a software program to understand how it works and how to modify it. Reverse engineering can be used for various purposes, such as learning, debugging, cracking, or creating keygens.
 
In this article, I will show you how to solve Freeservers Crackme Exe challenge using some tools and techniques. The challenge is to find three passwords hidden in the program's code and enter them correctly. The program can contain hidden files, texts, conditional statements, encryption algorithms, or other tricks that make it harder to crack.

## Step 1: Download and Run the Program
 
The first step is to download the program from [here](https://join.eset.com/en/challenges/crack-me). The program is designed by ESET, a cybersecurity company that offers various challenges for aspiring reversers. The program is safe to run and does not contain any malware or viruses.
 
After downloading the program, run it and you will see a window like this:
 ![Crackme window](crackme1.png) 
The window has three input fields for the passwords and a button to check them. If you enter the correct passwords, you will see a message saying "Congratulations! You have successfully solved this challenge." If you enter wrong passwords, you will see a message saying "Wrong password(s). Try again."

## Step 2: Analyze the Program with a Disassembler
 
The next step is to analyze the program with a disassembler. A disassembler is a tool that converts the binary code of a program into assembly language, which is more readable and understandable for humans. Assembly language is a low-level language that directly corresponds to the instructions executed by the processor.
 
There are many disassemblers available, but one of the most popular ones is IDA Pro. IDA Pro is a powerful and interactive disassembler that allows you to explore, modify, and debug programs. You can download a free version of IDA Pro from [here](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/).
 
After installing IDA Pro, open it and load the crackme.exe file. You will see a window like this:
 ![IDA Pro window](crackme2.png) 
The window shows the disassembly of the main function of the program. The main function is the entry point of the program and usually contains the main logic and flow of the program. You can see that the main function calls several other functions with names like sub\_401000 or sub\_4010B0. These are subroutines that perform specific tasks within the program.
 
To understand what these subroutines do, you can double-click on their names and jump to their definitions. You can also rename them by pressing N and giving them more meaningful names. For example, you can rename sub\_401000 as CheckPasswords and sub\_4010B0 as ShowMessage.
 
## Step 3: Find the Passwords in the Code
 
The final step is to find the passwords in the code. This can be done by following the logic of the program and looking for clues that indicate where the passwords are stored or how they are checked.
 
One way to do this is to look for strings in the program. Strings are sequences of characters that represent text or data in the program. They can be used for various purposes, such as displaying messages, reading input, or comparing values. To view all the strings in the program, you can press Shift+F12 and you will see a window like this:
 ![Strings window](crackme3.png) 
The window shows all the strings in the program along with their addresses and references. You can see that some of these strings are related to the passwords, such as "Enter password 1:", "Wrong password(s). Try again.", or "Congratulations! You have successfully solved this challenge." You can also see some strings that look like potential passwords, such as "ESET", "CrackMe", or "Reverse".
 
To verify if these strings are indeed passwords, you can double-click on their references and
