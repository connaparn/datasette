However, keep in mind that these explanations are not official or verified, and they may contain errors or mistakes. You should always check your answers with other sources or your instructor before relying on them.
  
## Tip 2: Use Math Stack Exchange
  
Math Stack Exchange is a question-and-answer site for people studying math at any level and professionals in related fields. It is a great place to ask questions about real analysis and get help from experts and peers.
  
You can search for questions related to *Introductory Real Analysis* by Dangello (2011) using the search bar or the tag [reference-request](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request). You can also ask your own questions if you don't find what you are looking for.
  
However, keep in mind that Math Stack Exchange is not a homework service, and you should not expect to get complete solutions for your exercises. You should show your own work and attempt, and ask specific questions about where you are stuck or confused. You should also follow the [guidelines](https://math.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) on how to ask a good question.
  
## Tip 3: Use Other Books and Resources
  
Sometimes, it can be helpful to use other books and resources to supplement your learning of real analysis. There are many other books that cover the same topics as *Introductory Real Analysis* by Dangello (2011), but with different approaches, examples, explanations, and exercises.
  
Some of the books that you might want to check out are:
  
- *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* by Rudin (3rd edition)
- *A First Course in Real Analysis* by Protter and Morrey (2nd edition)
- *The Elements of Real Analysis* by Bartle (2nd edition)
