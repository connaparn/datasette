Gandu (2010) is not a conventional film in any sense. It does not follow a linear narrative, but rather jumps between different scenes and styles, mixing reality and fantasy, black-and-white and color, rap and dialogue. The film also breaks the fourth wall several times, as the characters address the audience or the camera directly. The film is influenced by various genres and cultures, such as hip-hop, punk, horror, manga and pornography.
 
The film also challenges the norms and conventions of Indian cinema, which is dominated by Bollywood and its formulaic and sanitized stories. Gandu (2010) is part of a new wave of independent and alternative films that emerged in India in the 2000s and 2010s, which explore the darker and edgier aspects of Indian society and culture. These films are often referred to as "Hindie" or "New Indian Cinema", and they include titles such as Dev.D (2009), Udaan (2010), Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), The Lunchbox (2013) and Masaan (2015).
