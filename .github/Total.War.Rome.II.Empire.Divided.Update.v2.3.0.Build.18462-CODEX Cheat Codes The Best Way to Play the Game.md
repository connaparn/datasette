If you are looking for a way to enhance your gaming experience in Total War: Rome II - Empire Divided, you might want to try out some cheat codes. Cheat codes are special commands that can alter the game's settings, such as giving you unlimited money, resources, troops, or unlocking all factions and units. However, cheat codes are not officially supported by the game developers, so use them at your own risk.
  
To use cheat codes in Total War: Rome II - Empire Divided, you will need to download and install a third-party software called CODEX. CODEX is a crack that bypasses the game's DRM protection and allows you to modify the game files. You can find the latest version of CODEX for Total War: Rome II - Empire Divided here: [https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/total-war-rome-ii-empire-divided-update-v2-3-0-build-18462-codex/](https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/total-war-rome-ii-empire-divided-update-v2-3-0-build-18462-codex/)

After downloading and installing CODEX, you will need to locate the game's installation folder. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Total War Rome II. In this folder, you will find a file called preferences.script.txt. This is the file that contains the cheat codes. You will need to open this file with a text editor, such as Notepad.
  
In the preferences.script.txt file, you will see a list of variables and values that control various aspects of the game. To activate a cheat code, you will need to change the value of a variable to a desired number or text. For example, if you want to have unlimited money, you will need to find the line that says:

    campaign_difficulty_handicap 0

And change it to:

    campaign_difficulty_handicap 999999

This will give you 999999 gold per turn. You can change this number to any value you want.
