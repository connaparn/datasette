## Waste Water Engineering
  
Waste water engineering is the branch of environmental engineering that deals with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater generated from domestic, industrial and agricultural sources. Wastewater contains various organic and inorganic pollutants that can pose a threat to human health and the environment if not properly treated and disposed. Waste water engineering aims to design and operate systems and processes that can remove or reduce these pollutants to acceptable levels before discharging the wastewater into natural water bodies or reusing it for beneficial purposes.
