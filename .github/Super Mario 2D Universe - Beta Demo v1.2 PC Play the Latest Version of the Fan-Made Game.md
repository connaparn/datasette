Super Mario 2D Universe is a 2D platformer that features Mario and his friends in various worlds inspired by the official games. The game boasts colorful graphics, smooth animations, and catchy music. However, it also suffers from poor level design, lack of originality, and easy difficulty.
 
The game consists of four worlds, each with four levels and a boss. The worlds are based on Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World, New Super Mario Bros., and Super Mario Galaxy. The levels are mostly linear and straightforward, with few secrets or challenges. The enemies are mostly generic and easy to defeat, and the bosses are recycled from the official games. The game also lacks any power-ups or items, except for coins and mushrooms.
 
While the game is technically well-made and visually appealing, it fails to capture the charm and creativity of the official games. It feels more like a collection of fan-made levels than a coherent game. The game also does not offer any replay value or incentive to explore. It can be completed in less than an hour, and there is no save feature or high score system.
 
Super Mario 2D Universe - Beta Demo v1.2 PC is a game that might appeal to die-hard fans of Super Mario who want to try something new, but it is not recommended for casual players who are looking for a fun and engaging experience. The game is still in beta stage, so it might improve in the future with more content and polish. However, as it stands now, it is a stylish but bland fan game that does not live up to its name.

If you want to play a better fan game that features Super Mario in 2D, you might want to check out [Super Mario Bros. Dimensions 2](https://mfgg.net/?act=resdb&param=02&c=2&id=37797), another game available at MFGG. This game is a sequel to the popular Super Mario Bros. Dimensions, and it offers a unique twist on the classic gameplay. In this game, you can switch between two dimensions: the normal one and the inverse one. The inverse dimension flips the screen upside down and changes the colors and physics of the game. You can use this feature to solve puzzles, avoid obstacles, and reach new areas.
 
Super Mario Bros. Dimensions 2 has eight worlds, each with six levels and a boss. The worlds are inspired by various Mario games, such as Super Mario Land, Super Mario 64, and Paper Mario. The levels are well-designed and challenging, with many secrets and collectibles. The enemies are diverse and interesting, and the bosses are original and fun to fight. The game also has many power-ups and items, such as the fire flower, the hammer suit, and the star coin. The game also has a save feature and a high score system.
 
Super Mario Bros. Dimensions 2 is a game that showcases the creativity and talent of the fan community. It is a game that pays homage to the official games while adding its own flair and innovation. It is a game that is fun and engaging for both new and old players. It is a game that deserves to be played and enjoyed by anyone who loves Super Mario.
