# How Iris-mini-0.3.0 Software Can Protect Your Eyes from Harmful Blue Light
 
If you spend a lot of time in front of your computer screen, you may be exposed to harmful blue light that can cause eye strain, headaches, insomnia and other health problems. Blue light is the part of the visible spectrum that has the highest energy and the shortest wavelength. It is emitted by the sun, but also by artificial sources like LED lights, smartphones and computer monitors.

Blue light can be beneficial during the day, as it helps regulate our circadian rhythm and keep us alert and focused. However, at night, blue light can disrupt our natural sleep cycle and prevent the production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep. This can lead to poor quality sleep, which can affect our mood, memory, immunity and overall well-being.
 
Fortunately, there is a simple and effective solution to reduce your exposure to blue light and protect your eyes from its harmful effects: Iris-mini-0.3.0 Software. Iris-mini-0.3.0 Software is a free and minimalistic version of Iris, a popular software for eye protection. Iris-mini-0.3.0 Software can automatically adjust the color temperature and brightness of your screen according to the time of day and your location.
 
Color temperature is a measure of how warm or cool the light is. The lower the color temperature, the less blue light is emitted by the screen. Iris-mini-0.3.0 Software can reduce the color temperature of your screen to 3400K at night, which is similar to candlelight or a dim incandescent bulb. This can help you relax and prepare for sleep.
 
Brightness is a measure of how much light is emitted by the screen. The lower the brightness, the less strain on your eyes. Iris-mini-0.3.0 Software can reduce the brightness of your screen to 80% at night, which is comfortable for reading or browsing without causing eye fatigue or glare.

Automatic mode will change the color temperature and brightness of your screen based on your location and time of day. Manual mode will use 3400K and 80% brightness all the time. Paused mode will disable Iris-mini-0.3.0 Software and let you use your default settings.
 
Iris-mini-0.3.0 Software is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X and Linux operating systems. It works with any type of monitor, laptop or tablet screen. It does not interfere with any other software or settings on your computer.
